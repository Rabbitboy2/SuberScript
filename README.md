README
A small python script that adds OS wide keyboard shortcuts for the superscript e.g(²) and subscript e.g(₂) numbers. 

- The shortcut for supercripts is ctrl+shift+number e.g(ctrl+shift+5 = ⁵)
- The shortcut for subscripts is ctrl+shift+alt+number e.g(ctrl+shift+alt+3 = ₃)

I haven't tested these shortcuts for all applications so if your program supports sub/superscripts already or any of these shortcuts conflict don't use this script.

Dependencies: 
    Python 3 [install](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    
    keyboard Library [install](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/)
